    "### 4. How to Read the Volatility Surface\n",
    "X-axis (Strike Prices): The range of prices at which the option can be exercised.\n",
    "Y-axis (Time to Expiration): How far we are from the option's expiration date.\n",
    "Z-axis (Implied Volatility): Higher means the market expects larger future moves.\n",
    "Common Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Volatility Smile:\n",
    "\n",
    "Higher IV for out-of-the-money (OTM) and in-the-money (ITM) strikes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lower IV for at-the-money (ATM) options.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation: <i>Investors demand higher premiums for deep ITM/OTM options. </i>\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Volatility Skew:\n",
    "\n",
    "Higher IV for lower strike prices → Put Skew (fear of crashes).\n",
    "Higher IV for higher strike prices → Call Skew (fear of price spikes).\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation: <i>Traders expect downside risk (put skew) or upside bursts (call skew).</i>\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Time Decay Effects:\n",
    "\n",
    "Far expiries tend to have higher IV due to uncertainty.\n",
    "Near expiries have lower IV as price movement is more predictable."
